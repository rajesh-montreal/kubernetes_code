Each subfolder contains information that will allow you to configure, run, and test an example Business Metrics machine learning use case. Business Metrics use cases detect anomalies in metrics/KPIs that are directly associated with, or may impact, business performance. Each detected anomaly is assigned a normalized Anomaly Score, and is annotated with values of other fields in the data that have statistical influence on the anomaly, called influencers.
