## Getting started with machine learning examples

This folder is a complementary resource to the examples used in the [Getting Started with Machine Learning (for the Elastic Stack)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhLSfisesZIsGXp8sLxZiICYWAmdWPYJ8) video tutorial series.

### Videos & Datasets
The tutorial series includes 3 videos:

 - [Lab 1 - Detecting anomalies in a single time series](https://www.elastic.co/videos/machine-learning-tutorial-creating-a-single-metric-job) - see [server-metrics](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Getting%20Started%20Examples/server_metrics) for data and instructions
 - [Lab 2 - Detecting anomalies in a multiple time  series](https://www.elastic.co/videos/machine-learning-tutorial-creating-a-multi-metric-job) - see [server-metrics](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Getting%20Started%20Examples/server_metrics) for data and instructions
 - [Lab 3 - Detecting anomalies in a population](https://www.elastic.co/videos/machine-learning-lab-3-detect-outliers-in-a-population) - see [user-activity](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Getting%20Started%20Examples/user_activity) for data and instructions

Once you have the data ingested into Elasticsearch, you are all set to follow along the steps in the video(s) on your local Elastic Stack. Enjoy!

### Got questions?

   Have trouble running this example, [file issue on this repo](https://github.com/elastic/examples/issues/new). Got questions or feedback about machine learning, [we would love to hear from you on our discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/x-pack).
