# Feature importance for data frame analytics

In the notebook we assume that you have [Elasticsearch 7.6 or later](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and you run it locally on the port 9200. If you don't, learn how to [get Elasticsearch up and running](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/getting-started-install.html).

Set up a local instance of Jupyter using the following instructions

1. Set up a virtual environment called `env` 

```
python3 -m venv env
``` 

2. Activate it

```
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies for your chosen Jupyter notebook

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter

```
jupyter notebook
```
