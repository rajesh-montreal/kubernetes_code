This folder is for holding example code being used in blogs (so people don't have to use their personal repo).

When creating a new folder, name it the URL of your blog post (just the slug/path, not the full URL). For example:
 
- **Blog URL:** `https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-machine-learning-finds-anomalies-fast`
- **GH Folder:** `elastic-machine-learning-finds-anomalies-fast`

Be sure to include a README.MD in your folder that includes:
- Full URL
- Blog title
- Blog summary/abstract

**Note:** If the URL gets changed before publish date, please update the folder name. If this isn't possible, please update the README.MD of your code so people know what the correct URL is.
