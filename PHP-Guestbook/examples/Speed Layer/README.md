# Speed Layers with Elastic
These are some resources to explore Elastic as a Speed Layer (a fast, scalable search and analytics layer on top of existing legacy data systems).

`logstash_batch_export.conf`
An example of batch loading of records from MySQL to Elasticsearch

`dev_console.json`
A lab for Kibana's Dev Console

`kibana_objects.ndjson`
Importable Kibana objects (dashboard, visualizations, index pattern)

Everything was made in Elastic Stack 7.3.
